# YASIC
On this repository you will find a programming language similar to BASIC.

Also this is my first programming language made on python 3.

    #### Before use it you have to install the next things:
        -   Python 3.x
            *   Go to the oficial Python page to download it.
        -   sly (This is a python library).
            * use: pip install sly


## Which operations you can do?

    ##### Note: 
    - You can use camelCase, snake_case or mix they to name functions or variables.
    - The language doesn't recognize the parenthesis yet.

* ## Math operations:
    * ### Addition.
        You can add on these ways:
        *   2 + 3
        *   a + b (In this case 'a' and 'b' can be number or strings).
    *   ### Substraction.
        You can substract just with numbers.
        *   4 - 5
        *   a - b
    *   ### Multiplication.
        You can multiply on these ways:
        *   20 * 5
        *   a * b
        *   name * 3 (name can be whatever string that you want).
    *   ### Division.
        You can divide just with numbers.
        *   12 / 4
        *   a / b
*   ## Conditions:
    If you want to do conditions you have to follow the next structure:
    *   IF 'expression' THEN 'expression' ELSE 'expresion'.

    A example can be:
    IF a == 2 THEN a = a * 4 ELSE a = a / 3

*   ## Loops:
    If you want to do a loop you have to follow the next structure:
    * FOR 'expression' TO 'expression' THEN 'expression'

    A example can be:
    FOR x = 0 TO 5 THEN x * 2

*   ## Functions:
    If you want to do simple functions you have to follow the next structure:
    *   FUN 'function name'() -> 'expression'
    
    A example can be:
    FUN myFirstYasicFunction() -> FOR x = 0 TO 10 THEN IF x == 4 THEN x * 100 ELSE x
